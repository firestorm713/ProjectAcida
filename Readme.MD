Project ACIDA
================================
This is a project by Andrew Quesenberry, Austin Stoner, and Cullen McDevitt for Colorado Mesa University's Video Game Design Course.
Andrew's primary role was getting Marching Squares working, and getting the laser to correctly deform the asteroids made via Marching Squares.
Cullen's primary role was in creating the art and getting them working and functional in the engine.
Austin's primary role was making all the audio, music, and UI assets, as well as getting them to fire correctly in game.

Credit must also be given to the Unify Community wiki, which provided me with the code for Marching Squares
